# Mac-OS-X-Setup-Script

This setup script makes fresh installations of OS X 10.4 â€“ 10.14 more consistent and usable out of the box, relative to my own personal definitions of "consistent" and "usable". Be forewarned, it's more invasive than most `Defaults Write` setup scripts.

I believe that guest accounts deserve to have their defaults set properly too, so my script applies changes to both the current user _and_ all future users. Poorly-designed atrocities like iTunes and Game Center will be purged from your beautiful machine, never to be seen again. In other words, you should probably read through the script before running it, unless you just really trust my judgement for some reason.

This script was primarily tested on 10.6 Snow Leopard, 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, and 10.13 High Sierra, but some light testing was also done on 10.4 and 10.14. It won't run on 10.15 and newer, which are awful beyond repair. If you don't know what version to OS X pick, I recommend Mavericks.

I expect exactly zero other people to be interested in this, but feel free to let me know if you find it useful. You can also open issues to ask questions; I will also be _more_ than happy to discuss why I chose a certain default.
